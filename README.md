# Huffman_code
Huffman_code mini project allows to encode and decode files by Huffman coding 
according to https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/huffman-coding.
### Usage:
- To encode a source file:
  * run **driver.py e** *source_file_name* 
  "Source_file_name_e" file will be generated in the same directory.
- To decode the encoded file 
  * run **driver.py d** *encoded_file_name*
  "Encoded_file_name_d" file will be generated in the same directory.

The project directory contains *War_and_Peace.txt* (in Russian), *chinese.txt* (in Chinese with English prephase) and *empty.txt* files for testing purposes.
